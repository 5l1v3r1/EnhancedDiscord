# EnhancedDiscord
A simple way to load plugins and themes on Discord without token stealing and lag.

By default, this loads my theme, with some settings applied. More info [on its repo](https://github.com/joe27g/Discord-Theme). To change this, edit `plugins/style.css` or change the theme location in settings.

Extra plugins available at [the plugins repo](https://github.com/joe27g/EnhancedDiscord-Plugins). This will contain weird or niche plugins that should not be preincluded.

**Now with a brand-new graphical installer!**

### Installing the easy way:

*Currently, only Windows and Ubuntu 18.04+ are supported for the new installer, due to lack of devices to compile on*

Go to https://enhanceddiscord.com/ and hit the 'Download' button, or if you're lazy, click [here](https://enhanceddiscord.com/EnhancedDiscord.exe).

### ~~Installing the old way:~~

~~You can also use the console installer (no GUI.)~~

~~*Currently, only Windows is supported for this installer as well.*~~

~~Download: https://enhanceddiscord.com/ED_cmdline_BETA.exe~~

*(this installer is outdated and will most likely not work.)*

### Installing the hard way:

See the [advanced installation guide](/advanced_installation.md).

### Explanation of files:

From now on, please refer to https://enhanceddiscord.com for explanations of included plugins.

### Custom plugins

To create your own plugin, check out [the plugin readme](/plugins.md).

### Contributing

Feel free to make pull requests or make your own plugins repository. If you do make your own plugins, request the 'Plugin Developer' role in the support server so you can announce your releases!

If you would like to contribute to making ED cross-platform, download [Mono](http://www.mono-project.com/download/stable/) for Mac or Linux and compile the installer(s). I don't have a Linux machine with a GUI or a Mac, so I am unable to compile and test these.
